    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "Vancouver's population was reported to be of 662,248 in 2021, making it one of the biggest cities in Canada (Statistics Canada, 2023). As such, it is expected for crimes, such as theft, to happen. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this project, we aim to answer the following inferential question: does the proportion of theft-related crimes commited in the day differ from those commited in the night? The conclusions from this project could be extrapolated to the entirety of Vancouver and other Canadian cities of similar population density.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was found that predicted robbery rates in the United Kingdom increased the darker the areas were (Tompson & Bowers, 2013). Furthermore, commercial robberies in the Netherlands happened more during winter due to more dark hours during the season (Van Koppen & Jansen, 1999). Based on the current literature, our hypothesis is that the proportion of theft is more likely to happen during the night. Due to the dark and less witnesses, it is easier to stay concealed and carry out a successful theft.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for this project is the Vancouver Police Department's Crime Data, which contains the data about most crimes commited in Vancouver, and the variables \"hour\" and \"number of crimes\" will be used (Vancouver Police Department, 2023). Since the main focus is the count of crimes comitted on the day VS night, the proportion of crimes in the day VS night will be studied. Furthermore, the standard error will be studied too in order to report a confidence interval."
